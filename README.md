Python Game: Name The State

This project is a simple geography game where players need to guess the names of US states. It demonstrates the following programming concepts and skills:

GUI Development: Using the turtle module to create a visual interface for the game.

Data Handling: Utilizing the pandas library to read and manipulate CSV data containing state names and coordinates.

User Input and Validation: Taking user input for state names and validating against the data.

Game Logic: Implementing game logic to keep track of correct answers, update the map, and manage the game state.

File Handling: Saving a list of unguessed states to a CSV file for future learning.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilizing a separate ScoreBoard class to encapsulate the logic for updating the map and score.

This project is a fun and interactive way to learn about US geography while also practicing basic Python programming skills.
